# Senior Data Engineer Interview Assignment - Financial Data Synthesizer

## Objective

This exercise evaluates your ability to design and implement a synthetic data generator for financial data. The system must support structured, categorical, numerical, and semi-structured fields (JSON/XML/text).

## Requirement 1 - Schema Generation

**Input:** A business data scenario (e.g., CRM system).  
**Output:** Automatically generate a data schema or data model representing the system.

The schema should include:

- Multiple tables
- Primary and foreign keys
- Numerical fields
- Categorical fields
- Semi-structured columns (JSON/XML/text)

## Requirement 2 - Synthetic Data Generation

**Input:** A given schema (SQLite, PostgreSQL, Parquet, or Delta Lake). 
**Output:** Generate synthetic data tables with a configurable number of records.

The generator should preserve:

- Realistic distributions
- Referential integrity
- Categorical relationships
- Semi-structured field structures

## Encouraged Libraries

- Faker or other synthetic data tools

## Expected Deliverables

- Architecture design for the synthesizer tool
- Schema generation approach
- Synthetic data generation pipeline
- Example generated dataset
- Code implementation (Python preferred)
- Explanation of how data distributions and relationships are preserved
